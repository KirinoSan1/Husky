## Project description 📖

As part of the project, a discussion forum for the exchange of
knowledge gets realized. Users will be able to create
posts in threads in the traditional way or exchange information
directly with each other via a live chat. The forum is moderated
and administered by appropriate stakeholders. Users can hold
technical discussions as well as ask and answer specific questions.

Users who are about to buy a car, for example, can ask questions about various models, prices and features in the forum.
Other users can then share their recommendations based on their own knowledge and experience.

## First steps 🚀

### Requirements analysis

To determine the requirements for our application a use case diagram is created.

Furthermore, the structure of the application is outlined using a class diagram.

Based on the class diagramm tickets for the implementation are getting developed.

At the same time, the frontend and backend projects are set up in GitLab.

## Tools 🛠️

The use case diagram and the class diagram are created with [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/).

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or alternatively [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) is used as [IDEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment).

To visualize the data from the database [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass) will be used.

## Project structure 📂

There is a "frontend" directory containing all source code files for the frontend.

There is a "backend" directory containing all source code and test files for the backend.

The naming of the subdirectories follows a generally known structure. The source code, for example, is located in a directory named "src".

## Code Coverage 📈

In every backend endpoint file, we have successfully achieved a code coverage of 100%.

## Coding standards 📏

Essentially, we adhere to the Java code conventions:<br>

We also use the principle of guard clauses, if possible, to free the code from superfluous nesting:<br>
